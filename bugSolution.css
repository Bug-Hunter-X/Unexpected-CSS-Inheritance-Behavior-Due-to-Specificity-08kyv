To reliably achieve the desired `color: green`, use the `!important` flag (though this is generally discouraged due to potential maintenance challenges) or restructure the CSS for better clarity. Here is a better solution:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green !important; /* Less preferred, use with caution */
}

/* Or, use more specific selectors to avoid inheritance conflicts: */
div > p {
  color: green;
}
```

The second solution, using `div > p`, is far superior. It explicitly targets only direct children of `div`, creating clearer and maintainable code, avoiding the need for `!important`.

The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* Inherited color from <div> might unexpectedly override this */
}
```

The unexpected behavior arises from the way CSS specificity works.  While `div p` is more specific than `p`, the inheritance from `div` can sometimes lead to surprising results depending on the browser and how it handles inheritance in combination with specificity. In some cases,  the `color: green` might not be applied as expected because the browser might prioritize the inherited `color: blue` from the parent `div` even though `div p` is more specific.  This is not a standard behavior but a subtle edge case.
